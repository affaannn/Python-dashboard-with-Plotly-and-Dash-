# Python-dashboard-with-Plotly-and-Dash-

This repository contains the codes for Python dashboard built with Plotly and Dash. The dashboard displays various charts and graphs that allow users to visualize data in an interactive and intuitive way.

The code in this repository was developed while following along with a series of video lectures on how to create a Python dashboard using Plotly and Dash. The lectures covered a wide range of topics, including:

* Setting up a Python development environment
* Working with data in Pandas and NumPy
* Creating charts and plots with Plotly
* Building a dashboard with Dash
* Customizing the appearance and functionality of the dashboard

The code and a guidebook by **Jose Marcial Portilla(a udemy instructor)** in this repository can also serve as a reference for those who want to build their own dashboard or learn more about Plotly and Dash.

I hope you find this repository useful in your journey to learn about Python dashboards! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
